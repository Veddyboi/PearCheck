            Have you ever received a notification at 5 PM that you were absent from your 3rd-period class even though you weren't? 
            </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            Welcome to PearCheck, a revolutionary website designed to transform how attendance is managed in educational settings! We are a team of five ambitious and passionate high school students in Mr Kiyoi's APCSA class who recognized the need for a more efficient and user-friendly solution for students and teachers. Fueled by our passion for improving our community, we set out to develop an innovative app that streamlines attendance, check-ins, seating charts, and absenteeism tracking.
          </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            PearCheck was born out of a deep understanding of the daily challenges faced by students and teachers (and me being marked absent five times during study hall simply because the teacher didn't take attendance). We have experienced the frustration of long attendance processes, paper-based check-ins, and the time-consuming task of managing seating arrangements. Furthermore, we witnessed the negative impact of absenteeism on a student's academic progress. Simply put, our current attendance system couldn't cut it. 
          </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            With PearCheck, students and teachers can bid farewell to cumbersome attendance sheets and time-consuming processes. Our streamlined check-in system ensures that marking attendance becomes a breeze, saving valuable instructional time. Through intuitive features such as ID scanners and a consequent log-in through the school's database, students can quickly check-in and notify their teachers of absences or late arrivals, allowing for proactive communications and timely interventions. 
          </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            PearCheck also simplifies seating chart management, enabling teachers to effortlessly assign and modify seating arrangements according to their preferences and their student's needs. This feature promotes an optimized learning environment and fosters better classroom dynamics and student engagement. 
          </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            No one likes to be blamed for an attendance issue. What sets us apart is our unwavering commitment to community improvement. By harnessing the collective skills we've learned from years of coding, we developed PearCheck to address the small but essential challenges faced by students and teachers alike. We aim to empower educational institutions, enhance communications in a learning setting, and promote academic success. 
          </p>
          <p id="about-text" style="-style-type: none; max-width: 1000px;">
            Join us on this exciting journey as we revolutionize attendance management and absenteeism tracking. Together, let's build a stronger, more connected community, one check-in at a time!
